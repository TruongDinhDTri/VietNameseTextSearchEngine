## Project Info:

  * ***Brief Review:***  **In this project we're trying to implement the VSM(Vector Space Model) on Vietnamese Documents. We faced some difficulties while tokenized vietnamese words due to the complexity of vietnamese grammar and the abundance of meaning in vietnamese. We made the extra part about Query Expandsion but the result was not so good. Hope you guys like it**
